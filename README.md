# What makes a business investable?

A guide for junior associates

## Product-market fit

- Reducing Friction aka solves a problem
  - People are willing to pay for taxis but don't like the experience - a friendly person's own car can drive you around in Uber
  - Scooter shares allow you to have a commute exactly as long as you want without the attached responsibilities
- Purpose
  - Simon Sinek's start with why
  - TOMS - purpose allows them into customers who care about social change
- MVP-minded approach by listening to customers
  - Amazon as a book retailer
  - Zappos originally only bought the shoes after customers bought them
  - Dropbox simply created a video explaining what their product does to find out what the reception would be, rather than putting in the resources to build it first
  - Revenue is the best Proof of Concept
    - SaaS companies often build their beta out for a client, proving that someone is willing to pay for it while also getting funding relief

## Business Model

- Timing: not too early or late
  - Andrew Yang argues for an upcoming opportunity to do phone app voting
  - Flooz was a digital currency in the late 90s
- A large enough addressable market (real or buildable analog)
- Network effects
  - FB has the ultimate network effects - they found you only need to add a few people to stick to the platform. There was a time when people were worrying that a mass exodus on facebook would have perverse effects on the economy as there could be a critical mass of leaving members, kind of like people withdrawing money from a Lehman Brothers in 2008
- Good scaling economics
- Path to exit (IPO/acquisition)
- Intellectual Property
  - IP is a barrier to entry for competitors - leads to longer competitive runway while other try to figure out how to surmount it
  - Caveat - these can often simply be psychological barriers as there's still a cost to enforce IP
- 10x better than competition if there are incumbents
  - Spaces with big opportunity often have intertia - eg education (Trilogy Education and Digication)
  - MoviePass vs A List
- Possibility to keep founder ownership stake as this keeps them incentivised. This becomes harder as rounds continue but should still be preserved in Round A
- Ecosystem - will you have to build everything or is there a support system in place
  - Riot and esports

## Team

- Previous successes
  - The Lubins exited Reppr early so they could have a success on their belts
- Fitting background
  - Someone from EY has accolades, but is not entirely convincing when they expain an expansion strategy for a laundry app business
- Attention to key health metrics
- Focus on business rather than drowning in opportunity
  - Analytics on a book publishing platform
- Leadership is skilled at building teams
- Obsession
- Not a sole founder
- No strategic red flags
  - No strategy should be simply to hire someone
  - No 1% of 1% of market and good sanity checks for growth claims

# Conclusion

- Opportunity creates FOMO
- Unfair advantage
